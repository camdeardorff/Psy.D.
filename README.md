# Psy.D.

This web application is still in development. While the functionality is near completion the database is still incomplete.

Psy.D. is an interactive tool for learning about Clinical Psychological Diagnoses. Whether you are in the field of Clinical Psychology or you just have profound interest in Psychological Disorders, this is a perfect way to help you further explore the field.  
Although Psy.D. is a great tool of exploring the field of clinical psychology, just because you use it does not make you a practicing psychologist. Please use this interactive tool as a way to learn about the many mental disorders, not to use an exact diagnosis tool (unless otherwise licensed to do so).
